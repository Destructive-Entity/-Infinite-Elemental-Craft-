# Infinite Elemental Craft Enhanced - A Creative Combination Game

This project is a web-based game where players start with fundamental elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Air) and combine them through drag-and-drop actions to discover a vast, potentially infinite number of new items and concepts.

Taking inspiration from popular elemental crafting games, this version features a unique dynamic generation system. When a direct recipe isn't found for a combination, the game attempts to generate a new, relevantly named element based on the properties (tags) of the combined items, leading to unique discovery paths.

The game includes:

*   An intuitive drag-and-drop interface for combining elements on a workspace.
*   A persistent list of discovered elements using browser Local Storage.
*   Emoji visuals for each element.
*   A search bar to easily navigate your discoveries.
*   A reset button to clear progress.
*   The ability to clear elements from the workspace via double-click.
*   An enhanced, clean user interface styled with CSS.
*   All functionality built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
